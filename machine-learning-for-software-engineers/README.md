## Identify Job Description
contents from [How To Prepare For A Machine Learning Interview](http://blog.udacity.com/2016/05/prepare-machine-learning-interview.html)

#### 1. If a company is looking to hire a Machine Learning Engineer, it should be clear that they are trying to solve a complex problem where traditional algorithmic solutions are hard to apply or simply do not work well enough. It should also be clear they are also extremely motivated to solve that problem. 
머신러닝 엔지니어를 고용하는 회사는 전통적인 알고리즘 솔루션으로는 다루기 어려운 문제의 해결책을 찾기를 기대한다. 그 문제를 찾는데 적극적으로 참여할 것을 기대한다.

#### 2. What is one core problem I can solve for this company? 
이 회사를 위해서 내가 해결할 수 있는 한 가지 핵심 문제가 무엇일지 정의내려라 

#### 3. If you know what team you are being interviewed for 어느 팀에 대한 면접인지 알고 있다면
* picking an appropriate problem might be easy  쉽고 적절한 문제를 선택하거나
* choose something that is essential for the company. 그 회사에 핵심적인 문제를 선택하거나
* think about the challenges facing the company, and then try to determine the questions they’re likely asking. 회사가 마주한 문제들을 생각하고 그들이 대답하려는 질문들에 대해 결정을 내리거나 

#### 4. Dig into the company’s infrastructure and operations—what stack do they operate on, what APIs do they have, what data are they already collecting, etc. Most companies today have a blog where they often discuss their challenges, approaches, successes and failures. 
회사 인프라에서 사용하는 스택, API, 데이터의 종류를 조사해봐라. 회사 사이트(블로그)에서 그들이 해결하려는 문제점, 접근법, 성공과 실패에 관한 글에서 힌트를 얻을 수 있다. 


#### 5. How does machine learning fit into all this? Given what you’re trying to achieve, and the data you think might be available, can you cast it into a learning problem? What is an appropriate model to use? How would you go about training and evaluating it? To give you an example, the primary challenge that a lot of recommendation systems like Netflix and Amazon face is clustering, not prediction
솔루션을 찾아야하는 문제를 정의했고 다루는 데이터를 알게 되면 러닝 문제로 어떻게 변환할 수 있는지 생각해봐라. 적절한 모델은 무엇인가? 
예를 들어 넷플릭스와 아마존은 클러스터링 솔루션을 찾는게 핵심이다. (예측 솔루션이 아니라)

####  But everybody likes a candidate who shows genuine interest, motivation, and curiosity for a problem that is close to their hearts. You will be prepared to talk about issues that matter to the company the most.


#### 6. Depending on your interviewer and the stage of your interview, you may be asked more technical questions, but you should try to use any opportunity you get to demonstrate that you have thought about the company and role. When asked more open-ended questions such as “Describe a technical challenge you faced when working on a project and how you solved it?” try to pick something that aligns well with the company’s interests. 
기술적인 질문들을 대답할 때 회사와 직무에 관해 생각을 해봤다는 것을 증명해 보일 기회로 삼아라. 회사의 관심과 관련이 있는 프로젝트를 진행하면서 경험한 기술적인 챌린지의 해결 경험을 선택하여 대답하라.

I’ve found some data about wheat-growing regions in Europe that includes annual rainfall (R, in inches), mean altitude (A, in meters) and wheat output (O, in kgs/km2). A rough analysis and some plots make me believe that output is related to the square of rainfall, and log of altitude: O = β0 + β1 × R2 + β2 × loge(A)
Can I fit the coefficients (β) in my model to the data using linear regression?
