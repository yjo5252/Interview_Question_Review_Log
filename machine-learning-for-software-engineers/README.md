### Identify Job Description
contents from [How To Prepare For A Machine Learning Interview](http://blog.udacity.com/2016/05/prepare-machine-learning-interview.html)

1. If a company is looking to hire a Machine Learning Engineer, it should be clear that they are trying to solve a complex problem where traditional algorithmic solutions are hard to apply or simply do not work well enough. It should also be clear they are also extremely motivated to solve that problem.

머신러닝 엔지니어를 고용하는 회사는 전통적인 알고리즘 솔루션으로는 다루기 어려운 문제의 해결책을 찾기를 기대한다. 그 문제를 찾는데 적극적으로 참여할 것을 기대한다.

2. What is one core problem I can solve for this company? 

이 회사를 위해서 내가 해결할 수 있는 한 가지 핵심 문제가 무엇일지 정의내려라 

3. If you know what team you are being interviewed for 어느 팀에 대한 면접인지 알고 있다면
* picking an appropriate problem might be easy  쉽고 적절한 문제를 선택하거나
* choose something that is essential for the company. 그 회사에 핵심적인 문제를 선택하거나
* think about the challenges facing the company, and then try to determine the questions they’re likely asking. 회사가 마주한 문제들을 생각하고 그들이 대답하려는 질문들에 대해 결정을 내리거나 

4. Dig into the company’s infrastructure and operations—what stack do they operate on, what APIs do they have, what data are they already collecting, etc. Most companies today have a blog where they often discuss their challenges, approaches, successes and failures. 

회사 인프라에서 사용하는 스택, API, 데이터의 종류를 조사해봐라. 회사 사이트(블로그)에서 그들이 해결하려는 문제점, 접근법, 성공과 실패에 관한 글에서 힌트를 얻을 수 있다. 


5. How does machine learning fit into all this?

Given what you’re trying to achieve, and the data you think might be available, can you cast it into a learning problem? What is an appropriate model to use? How would you go about training and evaluating it?
솔루션을 찾아야하는 문제를 정의했고 다루는 데이터를 알게 되면 러닝 문제로 어떻게 변환할 수 있는지 생각해봐라. 적절한 모델은 무엇인가?
